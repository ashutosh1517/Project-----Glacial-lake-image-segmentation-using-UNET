# Project-----Extraction of glacial lake features using Deep Learning: UNet
Objectives: (1) Generation of Custom dataset (2) Development of UNet models (3) Extraction of Glacial Features
from satellite images using trained models (4) Time series interpretation and analysis of risk potential of glacial
lakes (5) Estimation of locations where New Glacial lakes are likely to form in the future.

– Collected images of Glacial sites from Google Earth Pro. Generated custom dataset (RGB images & corresponding
masks) using Adobe Photoshop. Performed Data pre-processing and Data augmentation (Albumentation library).
– Developed 4 UNet models (for 4 Glacial features). Performed Glacial Feature extraction on Test images. Based on
the Model outputs, interpreted Risk potential of Glacial lakes on time series image data. Proposed a methodology
for estimation of locations (glacial sites), where the New Glacial Lakes are likely to form in the future
