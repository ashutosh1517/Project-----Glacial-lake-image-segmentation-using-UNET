# Project-----Glacial-lake-image-segmentation-using-UNET
Objective - To find the segmented portion of the input image of Glacial lake.

â€“ Prepared custom Data-set (downloaded Data from Google-Earth-Pro & prepared in Photoshop & MS-Excel).
Executed Data pre-processing and augmentation using OpenCV, Albumentations library, and developed the model
using UNET, Segmentation-models-Pytorch.
Tested the model performance with some validation data, and compared the model output with the original mask.
